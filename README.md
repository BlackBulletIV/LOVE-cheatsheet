## Description

This is a cheat sheet for the [LÃ–VE](http://love2d.org) engine's API, and is still a work in progress.

## Contributing

I'd love it if you could contribute to the cheat sheet. To do this, just make a fork of it on GitHub.

If you're on a Mac with Pages, the best way of contributing is via the .pages document. Otherwise, you'll have to use the .doc document (I think you can use this in InDesign); but be warned, Word is a word processor, not a page layout plus word processor like Pages, but it'll still be good for submitting your ideas.

Thanks!
